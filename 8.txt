8. Write a shell script to list all the files in a directory whose filename is at least 10 characters.
(use expr command to check the length)
#! /bin/bash
clear
echo `ls > listfiles`
echo the file with characters greater than 9
for i in `cat listfiles`
do
len=`expr length $i`
if [ $len -gt 9 ]
then
echo $i
else
continue
fi
done
Execution and Output:
$ sh eighth.sh

The files with characters greater than 9 are:
arithmeticcalculations.txt 26
calender.txt 12
example.sh 10
seventh.sh 10
working.txt 11
