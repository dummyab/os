13. Write an awk script to delete duplicated lines from a text file. The
order of the original lines must remain unchanged.
BEGIN {
printf " Program starts\n" ;
}
{
if ( data[$0]++ == 0 )
line[++count]=$0;
}
END {
for (i=1; i<= count; i++)
printf "\n" line[i];
printf " \n\n program ends";
printf "\n"
}
Execution and Output:
Input file: file with repeated lines say --- duplicates.txt
$ awk -f thirteen.awk duplicqtelines.txt
Program starts
--------------
unique lines
