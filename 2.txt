2. Write a shell script that accepts two file names as arguments, checks if the permissions for these
files are identical and if the permissions are identical, output common permissions and otherwise
output each file name followed by its permissions.
clear
if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]
then
echo Invalid number of arguments
else
ls -l $1 | cut -d ' ' -f1 > file1
ls -l $2 | cut -d ' ' -f1 > file2
if cmp file1 file2
then
echo " \n Both files have same permissions \n"
cat file1
else
echo " \n \n Files have different permissions \n"
echo The permissions of file $1
cat file1
echo The permissions of file $2
cat file2
fi
fi

Execution and Output:
$ sh second.sh ext1.txt example.sh # ext1.txt and example.sh are the files in the current
directory
file1 file2 differ: byte 4, line 1
Files have different permissions
The permissions of file ex1.txt
-rwxrw-r--
The permissions of file example.sh
-rw-rw-r--
$ sh second.sh
Invalid number of arguments
